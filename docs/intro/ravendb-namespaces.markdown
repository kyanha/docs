RavenDB has several namespaces available.  In most cases, what you want will be under the Raven.Client namespaces.

Raven.Client.Lightweight | Start here (Client Profile compatible)
Raven.Client.Silverlight | For your Silverlight projects
Raven.Client.Debug | A lightweight graphical visualizer for requests and responses
Raven.Client.Embedded | A full embedded Raven instance (not Client Profile compatible)
Raven.Database | The main database implementations
Raven.Abstractions | Mappings of external concepts to RavenDB implementation
Raven.Json | (Doesn't appear to be anything?)
Raven.Munin | RavenDB's persistent and volatile memory structures
Raven.Server | The HTTP server that Raven.Client.Lightweight talks to
Raven.Smuggler | Import and Export
Raven.Storage.Esent | Windows-native, OS-provided KVP data store
Raven.Storage.Managed | Managed implementation of KVP data store
Raven.Studio | A Silverlight client for manipulation of the Server datastore
Raven.Tests | The test suite
Raven.Tryouts | A quick runthrough of ways to use RavenDB, and a quick stress test
